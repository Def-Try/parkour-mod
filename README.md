# Parkour mod
A mod that adds new movement mechanics to Mindustry. W.I.P.

# What mechanics does it adds?
WALL HOLDING - Hold SPACE. Using STAMINA to hold on walls.

JUMP - Press SPACE. Just a regular mod jump.

GRAVITY - Enable mod. Pushes you to direction of gravity.

JUMP PAD - small titanium wall. If you fall on this pad from height, you will bounce back. If you step on this pad and jump, you will jump higher than normal.

STICKY GEL - small plastanium wall. You can walk on walls and bounce off.

GRAVITY PAD - standart conveyor. It changes your gravity direction to direction of conveyor.

GRAVITATIONAL FUNNEL - titanium conduit. Slowly pushes you in direction of conduit. Still in development.

ANTI GRAVITY FIELD - shock mines. Just disables gravity for you while in field.

# How to play it on mobile?
Sorry, but at this moment it's impossible. I'm still learning UI libs and I can't make mobile buttons.

# WARNING!
Please, do not toggle parkour in flying unit and/or don't let unit fall to the void(black tiles outside of map)! It crashes the game.
